 ==================================
|   SIMPLE BRAINFUCK INTERPRETER   |
 ==================================

By Koushtav Chakrabarty a.k.a. The Illusionist Mirage

This simple interpreter for the brainfuck programming language
was written by me as a  small  programming assignment upon the
recommendation of texus(one of my best buddies). Also, special
thanks to him for bearing with me whenever the possible seemed
impossible to me.

Also, two brainfuck  project  files  called  'TowersOfHanoi.bf'
[ Clifford Wolf(http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/hanoi.html) ] and
'HelloWorld.bf'[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck ] have
been provided here for testing.

Please feel free to use this anywhere :)
